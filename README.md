Hi, I’m Bhumit Malhan 👋

I’m a first-year student at NSUT, and I’m currently diving into the world of programming! I’m passionate about learning Python and exploring how coding can help solve real-world problems. While I’m just starting out, I’m excited to grow my skills and contribute to projects.

🎓 About Me
	•	I’m based in Delhi, India.
	•	Currently learning Python and exploring the basics of software development.
	•	I’m eager to improve and expand my knowledge in programming and problem-solving.
	•	Looking forward to working on more projects as I learn and grow!

🛠️ Technologies I’m Learning
	•	Languages: Python (currently my main focus)
	•	Tools: Git, GitHub
	•	Other: I am also interested in learning web development and data structures.

📚 Current Projects
	1.	Password Manager – A simple Python-based password manager I built as a first project. It generates, saves, and retrieves passwords securely.

As I continue to learn, I’m excited to build more projects and share them here! 

🌟 My Goals for 2025:
	•	Become fluent in Python and expand to another language like Java or JavaScript.
	•	Build a portfolio of 5+ impactful projects (including real-world applications!).
	•	Collaborate on open-source projects and learn from the community.

🕊️ Beyond Code:

When I’m not debugging, you can find me:
	•	Binge-watching YouTube tutorials.
	•	Playing games 🎮.
	•	Daydreaming about contributing to open source someday!

 💡 Fun Fact: Half of programming is writing code. The other half is convincing yourself it’s working. 😬
